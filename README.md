SqlRunner
=========

SqlRunner enables sending the selected region in Sublime Text to a command- line
SQL client. Results are then put into a scratch file. By tying into the existing
client, this allows the use of informational commands (such as `\d` in `psql`)
to pull data that's not typically available via straight SQL.
